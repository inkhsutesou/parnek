        During the disaster a century ago
        Kjeseta was destroyed the least
        Although during that time, the entire coast was in need
        Kjeseta was conservative with the aid they gave to other villages and towns
        But it prioritized itself
        This was largely exaggerated and they gained the reputation of greedy misers
        This was also where the Golden Ferrit line was started although most of their operations have moved to Deru
