I chose background as a noble. So the back story I had in mind is im a child of 5 from a Noble family. The oldest is a black sheep of the family who I looked up to, who was fascinated with history and left to explore the world a few years ago. She sent correspondence periodically which became less frequent until they stopped

The parents, being traditional, were against all this adventuring business and a few years later wanted to marry me off as a political union. Me, not wanting to deal with that ran away but being pampered as the noble I was raised as, was having a hard time survining on my own, until a monk found me collapsing and took me in to their monastery, which is how i became a monk

Until I got kicked out eventually for being too fussy to clean and convinced others to do it for me since I couldnt shake all of the noble behavior in me, but thought it was a good oppurtunity to look for my sister, who may or may not have went to Parnek
