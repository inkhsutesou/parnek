Ash Ghillain (original name: Abelas Elgara = sorrows of the sun)

Characteristic: cold, calculated, shows little to no emotion, won’t talk if she doesn’t have to.
Ash grew up as a bright child with parents who took great care in making sure she is happy. They also taught her how to fight and protect herself so that she has some tools. She also grew up with her male sibling who was 5 years younger than she is. However, around the age of 12, due to an involvement of a cult that wanted to use her body as host for a lesser demon, her parents died protecting her and she has separated from her sibling. She grew up with her military veteran grandfather who influenced her to further her knowledge in combat and understand the world around her as something that will kill and eat her as soon as she shows a sign of vulnerability. Ash grew up hating yet loving her grandfather on the premise of gratitude for teaching her how to defend herself yet hate for pushing her through so much trauma and fear that she stopped being able to have proper social interactions with strangers. Thus, it led her to many awkward conversations and having silent meals with her grandfather. Ash decided to say goodbye to her grandfather when she turned 30 in order to search for her younger sibling and the cult that took away her parents. Her grandfather had given her pointers to finding her brother and a locket necklace with her family insignia inside as a parting gift. He told her that it will be important for her journey to know who she truly is. It’s the one item that she holds dear to her and promises her grandfather that she will bring her brother back so that he could see him once again.

	- Ash promises him that she will become the loving family that she wants back from the past and protect him and herself at all costs, no matter what she must do.
	- Ash travels with him for the time being to go visit grandfather and finds out the truth behind her necklace from a letter that was left for her and his will. She was adopted by her parents in order to hide her identity as a favor from her real mother who died right after giving birth. (they were friends before when her adoptive mother was a soldier for a king and her mother a concubine. Ash’s real mother was infatuated with the king and the feeling was reciprocated. After she found out she was pregnant with Ash, she ran away from the palace with her friend, only leaving a letter behind that explained that she didn’t want her child to grow up in a garden of lies)
