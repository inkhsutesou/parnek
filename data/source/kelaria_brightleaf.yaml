About 100 years ago, there was a great hurricane that destroyed the coast towns, including Marigrun. Many of the inhabitants relocated to other cities, but my characters family, were one of the few that stayed. They established a clinic, that treated those injured by the storm, at no cost. The extended families that relocated would send what crops they could afford to give away. My family network continues to operate like this today. My mother moved to a nearby village, Tiebern, as a farmer until she met my father and they opened a tavern together. Although the town is small, it boasts a diverse community, many of whom have working family in Marigrun.


Behind Kelaria's cheerful expression, she struggles with her so called 'gift', given by Boldrei. When she was little, even littler than she is now, she adored her mother, particularly for her mother's dedication to helping people. When Kel received her powers, she thought her mother would share in her excitement, but instead was told to keep it a secret- even from her grandmother (who also has the blessing). It wasn't long before her powers were revealed though, and her grandmother was as ecstatic as Kelaria had hoped her mother would've been. Since then, her entire life changed.

Instead of seeing her grandmother once a month, she moved into the temple for training- only being able to see her mother once a month since. The church held so many expectations for Kelaria, at which she was eager to fill at first. Then as she didn't show as much development as they hoped, the training grew even more intense. Just a few years after, her younger sister followed her to the temple, also having the 'gift'. Then it was a struggle, while Kelaria's sister was a natural for being a cleric. Kelaria's flaws began to be more apparent every day. The final difference between the two sister clerics, was receiving an oracle.


As Kelaria's grandmother grew older, the question of who would succeed the temple was increasingly becoming more important. Many of the temple members were split between the sisters, as to whom would inherit the succession. It was believed that whomever the goddess Boldrei favored, would receive a divine message, but she remained quiet for a long time. Then a month ago, Kelaria had an ominous dream. Ships parting through the fog of Parnek, docking at Tholn'den.

Kelaria didn't understand the message, other than to go to Tholn'den for answers. She feels hesitant, perhaps insecure as to her position within the temple. It was her hope that the journey would give her answers to : why was she chosen to receive the powers, when her mother did not? What did it mean for her to be Boldrei's servant, and was it a decision that she made, or made for her? Lastly, she wondered who she was without her powers/faith.

Marigrun was once a grand cliffside city, with homes built out of the white cliffs. About 100 years ago, a sudden and terrible hurricane destroyed many of the buildings, wrecking the farmlands, and destroying their small but growing shipyard. With the storm, many temples fell but the temple of Boldrei stood strong despite the destruction around it. Atop the sheer cliff, the temple did not budge to neither the winds that uprooted trees, nor the water that flooded the rest of the city. The storm lasted nearly a month, before it ceased, the only survivors were those that seeked shelter in the temple of Boldrei.

Every year since the storm, the city would hold a commemoration of the event. It would begin with a day of cleaning the city, and oneâ€™s own life- to donate what one did not need. In the weeks that followed, people were expected to wear blue and orange, the colors of Boldrei, to ask for her protection. On the final day, Marigrun would hold a festival, usually funded by donations to the city at the beginning of the month.
