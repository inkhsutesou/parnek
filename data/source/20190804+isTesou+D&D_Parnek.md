#### [+] Notes
  Boldrei, today there were many children with their ears torn off and I know I've been sent with reason.
  Let me know if finding the source of this heinous crime is your will.
  I know you will look over the children hurt by this time.
  What is next ?  Is this what you wanted ?
  I don't know why I'm here.

  Is this bloodless man involved with the man in black
  Let me perform your will

  Behind Kelaria's cheerful expression, she struggles with her so called 'gift', given by Boldrei. When she was little, even littler than she is now, she adored her mother, particularly for her mother's dedication to helping people. When Kel received her powers, she thought her mother would share in her excitement, but instead was told to keep it a secret- even from her grandmother (who also has the blessing). It wasn't long before her powers were revealed though, and her grandmother was as ecstatic as Kelaria had hoped her mother would've been. Since then, her entire life changed.

  Instead of seeing her grandmother once a month, she moved into the temple for training- only being able to see her mother once a month since. The church held so many expectations for Kelaria, at which she was eager to fill at first. Then as she didn't show as much development as they hoped, the training grew even more intense. Just a few years after, her younger sister followed her to the temple, also having the 'gift'. Then it was a struggle, while Kelaria's sister was a natural for being a cleric. Kelaria's flaws began to be more apparent every day. The final difference between the two sister clerics, was receiving an oracle.


  As Kelaria's grandmother grew older, the question of who would succeed the temple was increasingly becoming more important. Many of the temple members were split between the sisters, as to whom would inherit the succession. It was believed that whomever the goddess Boldrei favored, would receive a divine message, but she remained quiet for a long time. Then a month ago, Kelaria had an ominous dream. Ships parting through the fog of Parnek, docking at Tholn'den.

  Kelaria didn't understand the message, other than to go to Tholn'den for answers. She feels hesitant, perhaps insecure as to her position within the temple. It was her hope that the journey would give her answers to : why was she chosen to receive the powers, when her mother did not? What did it mean for her to be Boldrei's servant, and was it a decision that she made, or made for her? Lastly, she wondered w

  Boldrei today has been one big trial.  Telehorn way back, there was a bear attack and these poachers.  I'm confused as to what the right thing to do is.  One culture, living, other culture bears.  I intervened because I felt that the bears were overwhelming these humans.  I didn't realize how cruel people could be.

  I came here, and I should have asked for your advice.  My friend Magnila has an amulet, and people keep calling it the Cochlea amulet.  Something to do with the ears.  I feel that I must destroy this.  How Imthar may not be the best person to trust.  Perhaps give me some guidance.  I understand you have your reasons for choosing them for your congregation in Tholn'den.  I am afraid he might be easily pressured by those of Prarios.]

  I don't know if their work is legitimate, but I don't appreciate their message.  I'm sorry for my insubordination of Imthar.  Please make it clear to me.  I personally believe these mainlanders deserve to be a part of our family.

  I believe you can see much further than I can, if you could share with me, I would appreciate that.  Thank you for your blessings, Boldrei.
