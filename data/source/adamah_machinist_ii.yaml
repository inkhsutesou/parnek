I. Backstory : Session Zero

Adamah was meant to restore/protect something.
The research to do so was being completed in a small, library-like area.
There was another Warforged working in tandem with him.
He seemed to be working with a broken collection of controls and a large metal cylindrical drum.
The artifacts seemed to be Dwarven in nature.
The research was being conducted secretly because other realms were being promised that this research would not be done.

At some point however, Adamah lost all of his memories.
Enemies came into the research chamber and rendered the Warforged companion inert while he was trying to recover them.
As he remembered the research he was intended to conduct and protect, he tried to retrieve the cylinder and escape with it, only for the enemies to render him inert as well.

Theo was one of the four House Cannith Forge Masters.  The Forge Masters were human nobles who had all chosen to study in a faraway Dwarvish temple as opposed to the local colleges where they grew up.

Theo was devoted to Moradin, the Dwarvish God of Creation, in pursuit of grasping "true creation".  He, like the other Forge Masters, married the smithing traditions of the Dwarves to the crafting technologies of his noble house.

Adamah was Theo's favorite Warforged.  The Machinist II model Adamah was derived from was one that Theo escaped with when leaving House Cannith.  He reshaped the Machinist II body to remove most of its offensive capacities and replaced them with tools for study and crafting.  Afterwards, he partitioned the personality and modified it to prioritize curiosity, kindness, and creativity.

Though Theo modified and re-forged all of the Machinist units he brought with him after leaving House Cannith, Adamah exhibited more humanity than any other unit.  He is the "youngest" of the re-constructed units, the last Theo worked on.

Many years were spent with Theo both deeply praying that Adamah indeed had reached a state of true personhood and trying to disprove that this was the case and remain unbiased.

Wren (Human, Creator of the Facade Warforged Line)

Theo and the other Forge Masters were childhood friends who collectively decided to "do something different" as they neared adulthood and take up studies in a faraway Dwarvish temple as opposed to the local colleges where they grew up.

Soon after arriving to the capital of the Dwarves they were faced with the incredible differences between the cold and analytical way their homeland treated invention and the sacred, passionate way the Dwarves did so.
While humans had been making clockwork contraptions for some time, the Dwarves had created things that seemed alive and they saw a soul in every crafted object.
All of them devoted themselves to Moradin, the Dwarvish God of Creation in pursuit of grasping this deeper form of "true creation" and married the technologies of their homelands to the craft and tradition of the Dwarves.

Moradin was pleased with their humility and passion and gifted the four with a vision of the location of a long-lost forge hidden miles from the Dwarvish city they lived in.
They made the trek and were rewarded with the remnants of an ancient technology that they studied.
From this learning, they would go on to develop the Warforged.

I. Vendrick Vosenhaut : The False Manufacturer
[https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/xesteria/images/0/0b/LuthorBelgrave.jpg/revision/latest]

Vendrick is a talented public speaker and tactician.

He landed in Tholn'den in order to begin conquest of the land for the Vosenhaut family.  Before Parnek was lost to the fog, the land had belonged to his family and he was here to reclaim it.

He has expressed interest in assisting oppressed races such as half-orcs and tieflings regain proper rights in their homeland.
He also holds no bias against magic, as seen while he watched Din transmute the temple door on the island outside of Marigrun.

The noble claims he had obtained Adamah and had him worked on for years in order to restore his operations, though this clearly entailed manipulating Adamah's memories and locking his partition away in order to instead boot the less-sophisticated Machinist II partition.

While active as Machinist II, the Warforged was unceasingly loyal to Vendrick Vosenhaut.
It was only during the battle to murder the young lord's brother that Adamah was able to regain control of his chassis and memories.

Adamah kept a dying Vendrick alive to confront the man about his lies.

Suspending the noble's body in midair outside of Boldrei's shrine in the Singing Cave near Marigrun, the Warforged desperately asked Vendrick for a reason not to kill him for the threat he posed and what he had done.

Adamah fired when no answer came but Vendrick was gone.


II. Daemiin Vyre : The Every Din

===

IX. Current Story : Chapter Eight

The morning came.
Adamah woke with the thought that the others on the island, unlike him, required sustenance and that Din and Ash, for certain, had not eaten since the day prior.
He took time in the early morning to thoroughly look through the barrels and crates on the ship but there were no options available, only clean water and empty containers.

As he was ending his search, the others came into view and he waved them on board.
The Warforged began to explain how he had meant to prepare them food but the topic was quickly changed as the cleric Kelaria burst into an emotional outrage that the rowboat they had taken to the island was destroyed.
Adamah was a little surprised at this, she had not been upset the day before, but assumed that her grief then had prevented her from registering this particular loss.

Attempting to quell her irritation, he offered gently to recreate the rowboat later and everyone agreed it was time to leave the island and return to Marigrun.
Adamah was able to efficiently direct everyone into various positions to sail the boat efficiently.
It seemed it would be a peaceful trip back until another boat appeared on the horizon.

The boats sailed in the direction of one another, the party cautious as to their intentions.
Kelaria and Ash signaled to the other vessel a sign of Boldrei.
The other ship fired on them in turn.

Adamah calls out to Din to take responsibility for steering the ship, seeing the scholar as the most capable of picking up the process efficiently and moved to fire on the approaching ship.
His shot managed to catch the opposing captain in the shoulder and, as the incoming ship took a sharp turn in the other direction, the Warforged directly Din and Vyse to veer their ship past their attackers.

The attacking ship recovered and managed to bring itself in line with the party's vessel, now sending sailors over to board and seize control of the boat.
Din managed to trap some of them on the mast of their own vessel with a burst of sticky web, while Ash engaged them directly.

Adamah, still unsettled that there was no understanding as to why this battle was happening, focused his intuitive processes wholly on one of the men who had boarded in front of him.
The sailor seemed like he did not want to be doing what he was doing and felt it was a bad idea.

Doing his best to ignore a strike to the chest from another assailant, the Warforged approached the nervous sailor and directed his voice straight into the man's ears, in hopes of encouraging this idea he already had that the battle was not worth it.
Adamah gestured to the now-burning mast of the other ship that Kelaria had lit aflame with a burning arrow and Ash violently striking another man to the ground.
This fight is a bad idea, you should stop it now while we can - The Warforged told the man this calmly, standing eye-to-eye with him.

Kelaria calls out for the fighting to stop and a plank of wood is dropped between the two ships.
The captain of the other ship, a tough looking woman stoically ignoring the injury to her shoulder Adamah had caused, boarded the party's ship.
She introduced herself as Naomi Towerfall of the Azure Axe and explained that she was here on a bounty to hunt the halfling cleric Kelaria under order of the new high priestess of Boldrei, told to return her dead or alive.

A tribute to Kelaria's good heart, the cleric was far more concerned about the injured sailors on the other ship and asked for permission to go and heal the injured.
She asked Adamah to keep an eye on Naomi while she and Vyse boarded the other ship.
As the Warforged watched her, he turned his analytics processes onto her and gleaned into her surface thoughts.
He was alarmed to realize she was stalling them, awaiting reinforcements that were just beginning to come into view across the water.



VIII. Current Story : Chapter Seven

Daemiin Vrye howled a tantrum at the party for their interruption of his plans.
Without pause or warning, the rogue Vorux took a dagger and dug it into the old wizard's gut.
Daemiin screamed in pain, clutching his wound.
As the wizard recoiled back, another figure was ejected from his form, as if also struck back from the forced of the rogue's blade.

She was a woman who looked similar to Daemiin, similar to Din.
Old, cold and violent looking.

Adamah hears the voice of Vorux exclaim - "Take the rattle from the cloaked woman!"
But Vorux is no longer anywhere to be seen.

The halfling cleric Kelaria reaches out towards Daemiin and his body stiffens in response as she forces him still with the power of her mind and faith.

The Warforged is deeply unsettled by this turn of events.
Normally his secondary Machinist II partition, primed for combat, would offer an array of options for engaging in this scenario.
But now there is only silence.

As the party scrambles to dislodge the rattle from the strange woman's grasp, Adamah activates an active camouflage mode.
Sensors built into the skin of his body rapidly scan the environment and he feels a brief shutter in his body as its counterillumination and phased array optical systems activate, causing him to vanish from sight.
He backs down the hallway and hesitantly engages the cannon.

Procedural code frantically assembled itself, Adamah "understood" how the weapon worked but he did not "know".
His balance was thrown off as the leg pivoted into place and while he remained steady, he winced as he struck himself in the process.

Slowly and awkwardly, the Warforged began to aim at Daemiin Vrye.
As he did so, Din conjured a ghostly skeletal hand to grasp at this man he had once considered mentor and friend.
It clutched at Daemiin and a scrawny dragonborn was ejected from him, wearing the same glasses that Din wore.

The young noble Vyse rushed in to engage the villainous wizard, rolling past this new form that nearly knocked him into the warped time behind them as it emerged.
He strikes Daemiin in the back with his spear and another Din-variant emerges, this one wearing a three piece suit and top hat.

Adamah watches in growing dismay as the noble continues to strike the wizard, landing another blow on the wizard and knocking another form out of him.
A woman in a flowing dress carrying a lute, she lands gracefully.

The woman who had carried the rattle fires a fire bolt at Kelaria who manages to mostly evade it, but it distracts her and her concentration on holding Daemiin in place is broken.
Daemiin raises his hand and all of his new forms follow suit.
Adamah sees Din begin to raise his hand as well but he drops it moments afterward, as if breaking out of a trance.

The Dragonborn chants and Kelaria and Din both collapse to the ground, unconscious.
Daemiin Vrye and the other forms who had raised their hands begin channeling a dark magical orb.
He tells the form in the top hat - "We are here to punish some fools.  Make them disappear."

As Ash hurries to the unconscious Kelaria to administer aid, Adamah changes strategy and, disengaging his cannon, moves forward to grab Din.
He begins dragging him back towards the entrance of the cave.
Din wakes and Adamah releases him as the scholar begins rapidly crawling backwards.

He follows after Din until he hears the sharp sound of a bottle shattering.
Adamah looks back in time to see the floor erupt in a giant crater, the savage screams of unfamiliar voices.
The cavern now seems to be collapsing and the rest of the party is running towards him.

Adamah hears the monstrous scream of Daemiin Vrye comes from behind, inhuman at this point.
The sound of a splatter and thud are heard.

The dragonborn Din-like emerges into view just as a large rock is dislodged from the cave ceiling and crushes him beneath it.
The Din-like in the top hat and suit is now nothing more than a round, bloated balloon caricature, his face consumed by a distorted grin.
He floats eerily for a moment before being snatched out of view.
He is taken away by brutal angry screams and cries out in agony as ripping sounds fill the air.

The floor is giving way both behind them and ahead of them, as more and more of the ceiling begins dislodging and crashing down.
Din begins insisting that they follow him down a path that is in fact just a wall.
Adamah struggles to pull him forward towards the exit of the cavern.

As he leads him through the cave, the floor collapses beneath him.
The Warforged cannot react quickly enough and falls.
He cannot release Din quickly enough and the scholar falls with him.
He blacks out, his last registered event recorded as hitting the stone floor.

His systems reboot quickly.
It feels uncomfortably fast.
Missing the Machinist II partition must have sped this up.
As convenient as that is in this moment, Adamah does not feel good about it.

He sees the older Vosenhaut brother Vyse standing over him and registers a potent tart taste in his mouth.
He struggles to his feet and waits for Din and Vyse to climb out of the pit before making the attempt himself.

Even the Machinist II partition had issues moving with his misfit Thunder Cannon leg and Adamah was even less capable of complex maneuvering using it.
He prepares to climb out of the pit as a boulder from above falls towards towards him, a makeshift rope barrier erected by Ash succeeding in throwing it slightly off-course.

The Warforged reaches up and grasps Kelaria's hand.  He feels a comforting clarity upon touching her but it is still not enough to get him up and out of the pit.
Kelaria prays fervently and manages to magically lift the rock back up towards the cave ceiling.

One failure was enough for Adamah to calibrate and he swiftly lifts himself up out of the pit and to safety before the rock crashes down into the pit, where it would have certainly crushed him had he remained there.
He follows Ash's guidance as she points out the weaknesses in the falling ceiling as they escape out the entrance.

The entrance fully collapses behind them.
As they slow to a stop outside the cavern entrance, the Warforged's processes convert from a high-alert emergency state to processing information.
Everything that had happened and where they were now.

He sees the halfling cleric begin trying to drag the bodies of the young tiefling boy and the older stranger up a nearby hill.
He follows as his companions follow and help bring the bodies to the top of the hill.
The sounds of the island and cave are serene, as if no aggression or violence had ever taken place.
The air smells of the ocean.

He does not know the funeral process of Parnek so he studies intently as Kelaria proceeds to make a grave and bury the bodies.

Poorly equipped to dig or conduct much manual labor, Adamah assists how he knows to.
He kneels over the bodies and deftly weaves back the torn threads and ripped leather skins of their clothing, engaging the part of him which understood that much of what people called broken was merely misconfigured.

As the bodies are laid in the grave and his companions put their flower wreathes given to them in Marigrun around the neck of the tiefling boy, he follows suit in line with the tradition.

He is aware that, unlike everyone else here, he has no emotional attachment to either of these people.
The Machinist II partition was not equipped to form true emotional bonds, knowing only a single intense faithful passion to the Manufacturer and no other loyalties.
He regarded the tiefling boy he saw before him as a sad symptom of the state of the world he found himself in, a telling sign of what challenges lay ahead.

He is alarmed when he notices Kelaria digging another hole and regards her with caution until she explains that she is creating another grave for the druid Mugnilla, who had disappeared into the past.

The Warforged notices the cleric haphazardly sticking Haresfern clippings into the dirt.
Realizing she may be attempting to plant them, he gently moves in to correct the process.
Theo Samos had exposed all of his personal Warforged companions to nature frequently to help them grow closer to the organic world and parts of themselves.
Adamah was not Theo's greatest gardener by far, but Haresfern was hardy and required little more than a good start in the earth to flourish.

The halfling asks who he is and as he explains, he muses out loud what harm he may have caused this world.
He reminds Ash and Din that Vendrick Vosenhaut has one of the tainted bottles of wine he had prepared.
That Vendrick may be able to reproduce it if he has the talent required working for him.

Kelaria is uninterested in this brainstorming as she is in mourning.
Adamah understands the value of grief and mourning and responds that it would be good for them to grieve now and move on later tomorrow.

The party's initial planning for how to stay the night on the island is interrupted by Ash's recollection of the rattle she had taken from the strange Din-derived woman.
Everyone takes a moment to examine the rattle and Adamah remembers that he had seen Vyse toss some pearls into the grave they had dug earlier.
He asks Vyse if he has another and, since the noble did, the Warforged offers to conduct a deeper examination on the rattle, utilizing also a loose feather from Din's Lailoka.

Touching the rattle gives the Warforged an immediate sense that he is dislodged from his current place in reality.
All senses continue to provide accurate feedback that he is exactly where he was before, yet various internal processes ping the question of - "Is this elsewhere?"

He determines that the rattle itself is not magical but a container for a collection of magical beads, each of which are an anchor to a memory that represents a long distance teleportation point.
He explains this to the others and hesitantly suggests that perhaps Din could use it, though it does not seem safe.

As the party considers where and how to keep the rattle safe, Kelaria reveals they are carrying with them a lead-lined box.
Adamah knows the purpose of such containers and is concerned, especially so when she and Vyse were not forthcoming about its contents.
They quickly suggest the rattle might be stored there tomorrow.

Kelaria shares the vision she had when Vorux disappeared.
She describes a desolate urban place and a tavern called the "Blue Fin" but no one knew anything of it.

As the party prepared camp on the hilltop, Adamah quietly separated from them and made his way back to the ship to verify that the vessel was still intact.

While with his teammates, the Warforged had been careful to be calm and supportive.
But now, as he carefully checked the ship's functionality, he permitted his feelings of anxiety and discomfort to come to the surface as he ran diagnostics on his system.

Theo had always told him that every emotion was both a gift and opportunity, no matter if they felt good or felt uncomfortable.
He wondered what opportunities were in this concern he felt with every notification of a broken reference.
There were a multitude of fractured processes that were left to fall back to unpolished procedural runtime code now.

So many things that Adamah understood how to do but his Machinist II partition "knew" how to do.
Though he had reclaimed his body, it hardly felt that way without all of the core functions that had always been there before.

He became very aware of his leg at this point.
Adamah had never liked it.  Theo had not particularly liked it either, he remembered.
It was a meticulously designed part of the Machinist II units, back when that chassis was nothing more than a tactical war machine.
Theo had given Adamah a life without a need for such things.
Until that was no longer true, and this leg was a necessity for...something.

Guarding something, researching something.
What had he been assigned to work on?
He had to find out, he had to see it through.
Maybe the Dwarves of this time would know something.
The Dwarvish grandmother had recognized him.
If only she wasn't gone now.

The Warforged was sorting through his inventory at this point, verifying what he had access to.
He touched upon the spyglass and reflexively looked out into the waters with it for a few moments.

" 'Keep an eye on me.'  If only I could keep an eye on you, Theo Samos. "

Adamah wasn't quite sure how to feel about the halfling cleric and young prince she accompanied.
He had been manipulated once already.
An override of his hardware he could understand, but to fail now at ascertaining the nature of his new companions would be foolishness.
He felt certain they were not malicious but they did seem inexperienced, perhaps reckless in their own right.
Vyse did not seem to share the force of personality and wit of his brother.
The Warforged would have to be careful with them, guide their good intentions productively.

But towards what?
The arcane and unclear multidimensional threat posed by Daemiin Vrye?
Or the material, political threat of Vendrick Vosenhaut who was well on his way to conquer the nation of Parnek?
The two were related, Adamah considered, remembering how Vendrick had cryptically suggested the meteors falling upon Tholn'den were partially in accordance with his plans.

The Warforged settled in at the bow of the boat, overlooking the water from its landbound position in the brush.
Vendrick was likely long gone but, should his boat reappear, he would know.

Adamah spent until the light of dusk faded cautiously engaging and disengaging the Thunder Cannon.
Despite how he felt about it, he knew it was a valuable tool to protect and serve with.
As darkness came, he powered down, staring out into the waves.



VII. Current Story : Chapter Six

Machinist II moved immediately to complete his objective, attempting to move into the chamber and fire on Vyse.
He channeled his own power to provide a sphere of static resistance around Vendrick, hoping to keep his Manufacturer safe while he attempted to complete the assasination.

The chamber around him was filled with conversation as both sides tried to determine the intentions of the others.
The Warforged remained single-minded in his goal, taking advantage of an enlarging spell cast on him by the scholar Din.
He activated the turret he had with him in a defensive configuration to keep guard over Vendrick and his allies, cautiously multitasking to ensure that he did not allow Lord Vosenhaut to suffer needlessly while battle continued on.

Suddenly, there was a powerful magnetic pull from the entrance of the temple.
Machinist II resisted initially being forced to the floor only to be dragged over to the device and overwhelmed by its power.

Everything immediately shut down.
The reboot sequence began and Adamah was finally awake again.

He knew that his previous opportunity to disable this override was wasted, and he would not let that happen again.
He was able to access his BIOS and attempted to deactivate the overriding Machinist II partition but to no avail.

- P.a Machinist - MAIN BOOT, Hardware Override
- P.b Adamah - Disabled
- P.c Logging [1023yr] - Corrupted
- P.d Logging [1mos] - Enabled
- P.z ??? - Loading

What was this final partition?
It wasn’t anything the Warforged recognized at all.

Through the console upon which he worked, he saw Machinist II’s allies observing with concern.
Ash, the elven woman, poked randomly at what he assumed to be another terminal.
Din, the scholar, could actually read the screen and seemed to be studying it intently.
The Warforged was touched that they would care so much about a machine that had shown no concern for them outside of their secondary involvement in his assignment.

Adamah knew that in order to remain present, something more drastic would have to be done.
He could tell there was some form of hardware override in place, his body had physically been manipulated in a way that his mind would not be able to easily overcome.
The time before Machinist II rebooted and he was lost again was near.

He chose to override the Machinist II partition with his own files in order to ensure that it would not overtake him again.
It was a frightening choice.

His operating system was intended to work in tandem with the Machinist II framework.
Adamah himself was something like a fork of that programming, an evolution Theo Samos had developed over years of dedicated work, but Machinist II had always been a part of him.
An inner voice so to speak, something like the primal, animal instinct of human beings.
He knew as soon as he made the choice that there would be consequences, some parts of him that would be gone now.
But better that than for him to be entirely gone.

The reboot completed and Adamah was still here.
He remembered more now.
Parts of his long-term memory were still undeniably damaged but the memories he had were what he needed in the moment.

He looked back in the temple at Lord Vendrick Vosenhaut and knew that this man was not his Creator.
He remembered Theo Samos.

His once-enemies were laying into Vendrick, who fought back against them bitterly and with violent talent.
Adamah could hear Machinist II’s companions following him, asking him who he was, but he could think of nothing other than to confront the man who had him torn apart in the name of turning him into a weapon for his ambition.

He reached an arm out and set Vendrick adrift in the air.
The noble was stunned from a strike his brother had landed and even levitated in the air, he was not safe from the barrage of violence of Vyse’s party.

Vendrick was barely able to use the cave’s features to maneuver himself towards the exit and threw a bottle at the exit, setting it and the bodies of the tiefling boy and another man ablaze.
His pursuers were not deterred and Vendrick was briefly knocked unconscious by Vyse’s companions.

Adamah walked through the fire and reached a hand out and touched him, pulsing life and consciousness back into the man.
There was a painful conflict at play.

Because of his memories from long ago, he knew the terrible crime Vendrick had committed against him and anger rose up in the Warforged.
Anger that he had been mutilated and modified by someone who had no right or righteous intention.
Anger at the sullying of the title of his Manufacturer, that Vendrick Vosenhaut had stationed himself as someone who could possibly be worthy of that name.

But the newer memories were in place as well.
And the signatures and permissions and system logging and routines that had run for the past month were all covered in Vendrick Vosenhaut’s name, with intentions fully meant for him.
Adamah, through Machinist II, had been in something like a dream and in that dream, this was the face of the person he respected and valued most.

“You lied to me.” Adamah stated quietly.

Vendrick did not deny it, his indignation and rage had taken all social strategy from him as he bitterly replied that yes, he did lie.
Of course he lied.
They didn’t even know what Adamah was but they had spent years making him useful again.
Go do as I told you, the noble spat.

Adamah followed Vendrick as he continued to push himself off of the cavern structures and to the outside.
Ash had followed behind.

The Warforged lifted Vendrick higher in the air, twenty feet up, and sent a message into his mind meant only for the two of them to hear.

“Vendrick. Please, give me just one reason why I should not kill you now.”

When no response came, the rage finally spilled over and Adamah fired a powerful shot into the sky.
But Vendrick was gone.

Adamah re-entered the cavern and was greeted by an elderly Dwarvish woman who immediately began touching his body and examining him.
He greeted her warmly as she remarked that she had not seen anything like him in a long time and asked what his purpose was.
He told her that he was an experiment of sorts on the soul but also designed to document and archive information for his creator.

Suddenly he was reminded of the task that had been imparted to him before everything had gone dark.
Before the desert.

The Dwarvish woman bid that he and the others follow her deeper into the temple.
Down a long corridor, Adamah saw scattered lore from across multiple languages engraved on the pillars on all sides.
It took the Warforged a brief moment to activate his additional language processing sensors and he placed a hand on each pillar as they walked, soaking in the information.

It was a story about how Parnek had come to be hidden away by the fog.

Inside a chamber was a scene frozen in time, locked behind a magical force field.
Adventurers facing off against a powerful looking black dragon, seemingly midway through casting some kind of ritual.
Strange black inky leeches crawled around a slimy floor here, as if searching for something.

The elderly Dwarvish woman explained that she remembered the scene before them.
She explained that this was where the Order of Moon Hemlock ended.
She realized aloud that they had been misled in coming here, that Boldrei had sent them likely believing that the magic field was weakening.
When in fact, it was the leeches, Kortod leeches, that had the ability to make it seem as if a magical force were weakening.

Adamah, lacking all context for this, logged this data intently.

Suddenly, Din’s voice rang out - “And allow a way for me to enter!”
But it wasn’t the scholar Din that Adamah knew but an old man he had seen before.
It was Din’s tutor that Machinist II had come across in Tholn’den, Daemiin Vrye.

He chastised the party for their “rude greeting” as he appeared and the small cleric Kelaria attempted to hold him in place.
He explained that he was here to free Hazen'braouto as he and the scholar Din had done throughout time and dimensions.

The elderly Dwarvish woman watched on in shock as the combined party made multiple attempts to impede Daemiin's actions.
Ash succeeded at taking his staff from him but he seems to be unconcerned as he removes a pin from his belongings.

Vyse’s companion, the Dwarvish druid Mugnila, sent a small swarm of beetles to attempt to get him to drop the pin and their rogue ally threw a dagger at the wizard’s hand.

Daemiin laughed off their attempts, waving them away with a magical barrier.
He touches the pin to the force field and it began to vanish, a yellow glow penetrating the room.

The elderly Dwarvish woman tells young druid that their reunion is short as she begins to enter the opening into the scene.
The fighter locked into battle with the dragon is heard calling out - “Zansa'ba, is that you? You’re so old!”

Mugnila follows her into the field, insisting that she should help.
They re-enter the force field and age as they are warped into the scene.
The elderly Dwarvish woman appears at the warrior’s side, with Mugnila close behind her.

The yellow glow dissipates as Daemiin Vrye screams out in frustration.



VI. Current Story : Chapter Five

The party set off from Tholn'den, traveling north towards Marigrun.
Even on horseback, it was a long journey.

Along the way, Din shared his own magical capabilities with Machinist II and inquired as to what abilities the Warforged had.

Machinist II did not comprehend his own abilities as magical ones.

They were capabilities that had been meticulously programmed and constructed into his body, small functions with various effects that could be re-arranged and engaged with various degrees of power.

Nevertheless, that felt complex and unnecessary to explain to the scholar, so he simply explained what he was capable of doing at the time to the man who seemed to take note of it.

By nightfall, they were able to reach the town of Bluefield.

After stabling their horses, they entered the Galleon Arms, a local inn renowned for delicious food.
Inside the party saw Parnek natives and those from the mainland.
There was tension between the groups, a bit of disagreement here and there, but it seemed that all were too tired to really fight with one another.

They were greeted by the owner who had taken the opportunity to triple his rates, given the influx of business.

The party hesitated to pay for such an expensive room as the tavernkeeper attempted to persuade them to stay.

He informed them that meals were included and access to the rumors spreading throughout the Galleon Arms might be useful.

Machinist II, having no need to eat or sleep, was unconvinced until the man began talking about Kelaria, the Boldrei cleric that they had been told was traveling with Vyse and Mugnila.

The man seemed to care very much for his town.
He waxed on sadly about how the Boldrei cleric had left after being so useful, healing many injured people.
He dropped his rate from six copper per person to six copper for the whole party, proclaiming that he could tell the party were good people.

Though lodgings and food were still not of much interest to the Warforged, the promise of access to information seemed accurate, so he was willing to pay.

The party overheard children singing a heroic song about Mugnila, though they were quickly cut off by the nearby adults.
Pulling his cloak hood deeper over his face to prevent his identity from startling anyone, the Warforged took a seat at a nearby table and casually asked if the adults were preventing the children from causing a scene.

He was told that usually this behavior would not be a problem, however there had been rumors that Mugnila was engaged in witchcraft and it no longer felt like a good idea to speak much about her aloud.

In the midst of this, three men burst into the inn, wearing the garb of the worshippers of Prarios.
Machinist II turns away from them, wishing to avoid the conflict they presented as they began attempting to recruit more to their side, proclaiming the danger that those from the mainland presented.


As they approached a table that a number of Orn'Tal citizens were seated at, one of the Prarios worshippers grabbed a tiefling man and shoved him to the ground.
"Both a mainlander and a dirty tiefling!" was the accusation, as the prone merchant explained he was only here for business.

Machinist II had no reason to be involved in any of this, it did not relate to their objective.

However, he saw Ash approach the followers and dump a tankard of ale onto one of them.

And then, the elf was grappled by one of the followers, who held her in place and attempted to assault her.

Now unwillingly invested in the situation, needing to maintain his companions, the Warforged quietly left the inn and located a mostly isolated vantage point from which he would have a clear shot at the Galleon Arms doorway.

There was a couple embracing romantically in the corner area he had selected.
With a good amount of clever insight, Machinist II simply approached the couple and greeted them, staring intently at them until the discomfort of that situation caused them to leave.

He engaged his cannon and waited to see if his companions would be in danger of being dragged from the tavern by these worshippers.
Within a few minutes however, the Prarios followers were dragged out into the street by a strong dwarf man.

Concluding the danger was over, Machinist II re-entered the bar, paying little mind to the dwarf's opportunism as he plundered the pockets of the unconscious worshippers.

After that show of resistance, the Galleon Arms owner became more interested in the party and tried to convince them to look into a problem that was plaguing their town.
Savages were wandering the outskirts, causing destruction and death.
Machinist II had no interest in doing this.
The innkeeper's suggestion that information about Mugnila might be available with the savages was a weak one from the Warforged's perspective.

However, Ash and Din seemed more convinced so he reluctantly agreed to investigate.

The party was refunded their stay for agreeing to look into the issue and led to a very small room.
Machinist II waited with the party long enough to receive a plate of food and then excused himself, offering the space to the two organic party members who had a greater need of comfortable sleep space.

Once alone, the Warforged experimented with eating again.
He had been certain this was not a requirement for him, that there was no reason for him to eat.
Yet his systems responded.
This discrepancy was a lack of knowledge he had about himself and a lack of knowledge is a vulnerability.
From the outside, it likely looked that Machinist II was embarrassed about his interest in eating but in reality, it was a calculated distrust and concern over revealing any weakness to others.

After taking a bite of the steak and mashed potatoes, he sensed a write-process fire off to a non-existent endpoint.
Incapable of gaining any other insights, he spent some time re-assembling a schematic he had remembered in his near-death experience from ingesting the mysterious rage-inducing potion from before.

It was a blueprint for a number of modular parts that could rapidly attach to one another in order to form a mechanical turret with a variety of configurable abilities depending on how it was assembled.

He later powered down into an inactive state, watching the Galleon Arms diligently.
Nothing of note came to pass throughout the night and he re-joined the party for breakfast in the morning.

Ash looked skeptically at him in the morning as he ate the eggs and pork bacon with the party - He quickly excused the behavior as a need to blend in with others.

They left in the direction the savages were reported to be in afterwards.
Din sent his pet owl off ahead of him and through the well-trained bird, they were able to learn the locations of savage, uncivilized-seeming humanoids who were violently wandering the forest, periodically striking out or screaming at whatever was near them.

Remembering his instruction to keep an eye on his smith, the Warforged looked in the direction of Tholn'den using his spyglass whenever he peaked a hill on horseback and was comforted that he could yet barely make out the cityscape in the distance.

It seemed most advantageous to him if they were able to eliminate the savages from a distance, so he requested that Din have his pet distract the targets so he could snipe them from afar.
This strategy turned out generally well, especially with Din's ability to lull the enemies to sleep.

Already impatient, the Warforged pressed the party ahead to a cave that it seemed the savages may have taken up refuge in.
Machinist II tried firing a shot into the cave to lure any other attackers outside but no one came.

Infusing a copper coin with a strontium aluminate coating and a quick spark of light to supercharge it, he proceeded into the den, Ash scouting ahead of him.

The stench of the cave was disgustingly powerful.
The Warforged immediately elected to turn off all olfactory sensors.
When Ash pointed out something moving within a mass of corpses in a room a few feet away, he fired a shot into the mass of bodies with the intent of killing whatever was hiding in it.

Suddenly, he felt a blunt force impact him in response, as if he were feeling the power of the shot.
Knocked onto the ground, he watched as a looming humanoid mass of flesh shambled over to him and pressed its boot down onto his body.
Ash attempted to pull him away but could not move his heavy chassis.
He stumbled up himself, backing up and reactively charging his body with energy to deflect the blows of this mysterious creature, firing on it again.

He sensed Ash behind him fleeing fearfully into the next room.
He was knocked prone again, collapsing into the doorway of that same room.

And this time, when the creature moved to strike at him, he felt the impact ring through his entire body and system.
It was so powerful, he knew that he would not have been able to repel it, even if he had tried.
The damage nearly rendered him inert in that single blow.

Ash and Din were nowhere he could see them.

The Warforged desperately backed away and fired again, managing to knock the creature over.
From inside of a nearby crate, the elf popped out and stabbed the creature with her daggers.

Sensing that he could go offline at any moment, Machinist II quickly threw down the self-assembling pieces of the turret he had worked on the night before, laying them out in the required sequence to activate the "defender mode".
He placed a hand on the spherical machine and it pulsed a white light, sending a puff of cool air flying out from it.
A current of revitalizing energy rode this wind, nothing that could restore the physical damage done to the Warforged but it was a positive charge that re-energized his systems.

He attempted to fire on the monstrosity again but missed.
Thankfully Ash was able to continue stabbing it until it ceased moving.
Instructing the turret to dismantle, he looked over the still mass of foul flesh.
Its structure was unusual.
Din was able to dissect it properly and show how it was not formed like a human at all, but rather stitched and fused together with multiple oddly configured bone structures.

The party continued exploring the cave, the Warforged now wary due to his failing body, yet still impatient.
Thrusting open a door recklessly, he was struck by a number of spears and brought again to the brink of shutting down.
He considered this a sign to stop and re-assembled his defensive turret and let his companions carry ahead without him.

They found nothing of use there, both an unsurprising and disappointing development.

As they were leaving, Machinist II noticed a bracelet Ash was examining in her hands.
He recognized it as an extra-planar communication device, used to contact others between realities beyond the physical one they found themselves in now.
An interesting item but ultimately irrelevant to their current goal.

The party stopped by Bluefield once more and Din and Ash shared their discoveries and experiences with the Galleon Arms owner.
Machinist II, disappointed by both the waste of time and the cessation of the benefits from eating before, passed his plate of food along to his companions and was eager to leave for Marigrun as soon as possible.

On the road there, he asked Din about a catalyst for the rage-inducing potion he had been evaluating earlier, asking about a substance that might be used to induce a heated fever state.
Din knew of a plant, Brim Ivy, that would incite fever.
The effect was powerful enough that parents warned their children away from it.
The Warforged collected some on the way, ever closer to brewing his concealed posion.
He looked back towards Tholn'den on occasion, no longer able to see it from so far away.

As they approached Marigrun, Machinist II noticed that men dressed in blue and gold were taking visual note of the visitors entering the city gate.
He quickly cast a disguise on himself, choosing the first image that came to mind.
A young tanned man with a mop of white hair and wearing a set of brown and plum robes, looking much like a scholar himself.

The party was greeted kindly and invited to bear witness to the Ritual of Decision that would determine the next high priestess of Boldrei.
Din inquired as to the candidates and the party learned that, while Kaliopa Brightleaf was considered the only real contender, Kelaria Brightleaf could also possibly be chosen.

On their way into the city, the party notes a dense crowd and a procession leading into the keep.
The halfling Kaliopa was heading to partake in the Ritual of Decision.
And following shortly behind her came Kelaria, along with what could only be assumed to be Mugnila, another stranger ...
And Vyse.

It was not possible or safe to attempt to assassinate Vyse here, Machinist II knew that immediately.
Vyse, Mugnila, Kelaria, and the unknown fourth stranger entered the keep and the gate closed.

The Warforged left then for a high vantage point, telling Din who inquired after him that he would be there as long as needed.
Dropping the illusion of his disguise as he climbed up an exterior walkway, he settled on the highest rooftop he would have access to and stared intently into the keep.

His targets reappeared within a few hours but they were slipping away towards the docks.
Caught off-guard, Machinist II broke into a desperate sprint to catch up with them.
By sheer luck, his companions saw him running for the docks and followed.

A boat owner began greeting him but the Warforged heard nothing he said, only registering the man as someone responsible for boats.
He chucked a golden coin at the human, leapt into the first decent boat he saw, and began sailing to give chase to Vyse's group who had already set out on the water.

The Warforged did not know that he knew the workings of a sailing boat until he started operating it and found then that it came somewhat easily to him.
With the help of his companions, his proficiency with sailing, and the spyglass, they were able to track their targets through the light fog to an island.

Machinist II landed the boat nearby the vessel their targets had used to reach the island, concealing it in the brush a distance away.
Without hesitation, he then immediately blew apart the boat that Vyse and his party had ridden in with the intention of eliminating any avenue of escape they had.

As Din set out his owl to scout, the Warforged unit, now fully engaged in his objective, began explaining his processes to the party.
He intended to mix a variant of the rage-inducing potion that could be concealed, a hidden poison that would bring Vyse's team to murder one another, making for a much easier assassination.

Din had a valued Parnek wine with him, an ideal delivery mechanism.
The Warforged began grinding the ivy and brewing the tainted wine, mixing a careful ratio of potion and catalyst as he did so.
Having seen the social exploits of Ash turn out against all odds in her favor time and time again, he requested those abilities be put to use in an attempt to get this poison into the systems of their targets.
He asked Din to recreate the wine label on their smaller bottles and the scholar and elf convened on social strategy as Machinist II focused all of his attention on brewing.

The Warforged noted a ship approaching in the distance and gestured as he worked to bring it to the attention of his companions.
He was so focused on his work, however, that Ash had to be the one to point out to the Warforged that the ship was no ordinary ship but, in fact, a Vosenhaut ship.

Machinist II was shocked and happy to see his creator exiting the ship and immediately made his way over to him.
The manufacturer had gathered a large amount of intelligence about this island and was here to help ensure that the assassination was a success.
Lord Vosenhaut agreed to follow along with the planning of Machinist II and his companions and they took off together, the four of them, into the forest, with the Warforged pushing a cart of gunpowder Vendrick had brought for this task.

The destination was a huge stone door of Boldrei.
Tracks of their targets led directly to it.

As the party stationed themselves outside of it, Lord Vosenhaut asked Machinist II exactly what his plan was, inquiring about the bottles they were preparing to use.
The Warforged explained the weapon he had found and created with the assistance of his allies and felt joy at seeing that his creator seemed impressed and interested.
Vendrick attempted to receive a bottle from Ash, who hesitated.
Seeing her hesitation and feeling a flash of agitation that she would deny Lord Vosenhaut his request, Machinist II took one of the bottles directly from her and gave it to his smith.

The plan was for Ash to pose as a victim of near-drowning, to be grateful to Vyse and his companions for their assistance, and offer to share some wine with them.
The elf banged loudly on the stone door to attempt to gain the attention of their targets to no avail.
Din had brought up his ability to transmute materials earlier during their preparations on the island so Machinist II asked for him to do this now.
They needed to make an opening for Ash to get inside.

Din wisely reminded the Warforged that the deception would not be very effective if Ash were essentially blasting her way inside.
Pondering this for a moment, Machinist II offered himself up as the villain of the scenario, giving Din and Ash the opportunity to be escaping from him.
In order to make plausible that the Warforged lost sight of them, Machinist II suggested that Din summon fog after the door is opened in order to provide cover for an escape.

As Din worked to transmute the stone door, Vendrick looked on in approval.
Though magic would have the scholar hanged in Parnek, Lord Vosenhaut would consider no such thing himself.

The door gradually shifted form, from stone to wood, as Machinist II assisted his manufacturer in setting out the gunpowder.
Ash and Din remained a bit closer to the explosion in order to get caked in the dirt and dust, while the Warforged stood in front of Vendrick to assure the noble was not injured in the explosion.

The door was torn open violently.
In the fog stood their targets.
And the tiefling boy from so many days ago in Tholn'den lay dead on the cold floor before them.



V.  Current Story : Chapter Four

Lord Vosenhaut entrusted the party with a symbol of his royal house, used to gain the cooperation of his household.
Din took possession of the symbol and the party left the interior of the ship.
Machinist II had suggested to check the records of those who had entered Tholn'den in order to find information about Vyse Vosenhaut.

From the docks, Machinist II notices some locals who had appeared to be fighting being broken up by Vosenhaut guards.
Unconcerned, the Warforged looks instead for any important looking soldiers and he sees a tent with officials standing over a map.
Machinist II held back and waited for Din and Ash to get information from the soldiers.
He was still concerned about receiving a poor response after his social mishaps the other day.
The soldiers told the party that the records could be found at the castle and that Tholn'den guards from the docks would be currently detained at the constable's tower.

The Warforged, aware of his limitations in interacting with others, elected to go with Din to the castle to search the records.
As he scanned the books, he noticed out of the corner of his eye that Din had started copying down the contents of a page.
Machinist II moved to take a look and saw that Vyse Vosenhaut's information was written on this section of the book Din was holding.
After the scholar copied the information, Machinist II ripped the page quietly from the book altogether to prevent anyone else from interfering with their information.

They met with Ash at the constable's tower, down in the cramped basement jail.
Din tended to the wounds of the Tholn'den record keeper, who seemed a bit grateful, though still quite unhappy with his situation.
They learned that the man had indeed checked in a Vyse Vosenhaut, correlating with what was found in the record books.
They learned that he had irritated the record keeper enough to be detained and that, while the vagrant noble was eventually released, he had also been required to check in with the city daily.
Vyse had apparently taken on bounty work in Tholn'den - According to this man, he had brought a warlock who had been stealing the ears of the people nearby.

Din also asked about the other "Din" name listed in the record book - It is strange in that it is entirely lacking in detail.
All other names have details such as occupations and itemized records of possessions.
The record keeper waves away the idea of the name as a mistake of a scribe, that it is impossible that he allowed someone through with no details.

Machinist II asked a guard if the warlock was still imprisoned here, the guard seemed not to know.
Din went upstairs to search the constable's office while he and Ash went to ask some of the guards about the warlock.
One of the guards they interrogated seemed prepared to talk but nervous about the Vosenhaut guard who was also standing nearby.
The Warforged gave an excuse to lead the guard away, freeing Ash to talk with the prisoner more easily.

As they converge, she explains that a folk hero named Mugnila had brought in the warlock and his conspirators.
Mugnila and her companions interrogated the warlock and then, as they were leaving, chaos ensued and the warlock escaped.
Machinist II hurried back to the prisoner and showed him the picture of Vyse from the locket, the man confirming this was one of the members of Mugnilla's group.

They met with Din upstairs who confirmed that Mugnila Coppice was listed in the constable's documents as the person who had turned in the warlock and four cohorts.
The incident was dated as happening a few nights ago.
As they prepared to leave the room, Din gestured to a locked cabinet that he had not been able to open.
Machinist II set to work on it with his tools and got it open.  Inside was a large collection of copper coins, a dagger, and two strange potions.

The Warforged asked Din if he recognized the potions.  The scholar only knew they were meant to be ingested and were of the same mixture.
Intent on ascertaining their value, Machinist II used the dagger to inflict a small wound on himself.
He then drank the potion.

His body felt as if it were on fire with power.  It overwhelmed his systems, a heated and rapid emotion that could only be thought of as "primal" overtook him.
His sensory information fired erratically and unnaturally, the heat signatures around him registering as hostile.
He engaged his Thunder Cannon and prepared to fire on them when exhaustion suddenly overtook him.

Blue.
His processes shutting down.
Nothingness.
Breaking and pain.

He woke in an old chamber filled with books.
Another Warforged unit was powered down nearby.
Suddenly, he sensed enemies approaching beyond a set of doors.
He fired on them repeatedly, unknowingly destroying his body and his surroundings in the process.
The enemies seemed to be endless.
Machinist II looked to the books around him, they were printed cleanly but he could not read the script.

Inside of him, a device flickered.

QUERY : "How do I boot you?"
RESPONSE : "Device incapable."

QUERY : "What is your purpose?"
RESPONSE : "Holds."

There was only darkness now.
After some time, the Warforged began coming back online.
Only this time, for a brief period of time, it was not Machinist II online.
But Adamah.

The Adamah OS was put into a nearly hopeless situation.
In a room he did not recognize, with a man he did not recognize, with no memories.
He struggled to articulate himself, discover where he was, while the Machinist II partition slowly loaded in the background.

Machinist II loaded and attempted to show Din the other potion, explaining that all of the destruction that had taken place may end up being worth it.
The potion was missing, so the Warforged weakly began searching for it.
Ash arrived around this time.  Thankfully Din was able to find the potion.
Machinist II explained that he had plans for the substance and disguised himself as a Vosenhaut guard in order to escape the tower without causing alarm.

Back on the ship, he mended his body and, as he did so, thought on the things he had seen while disabled.
He also began analyzing the potion, utilizing his poisoning and alchemy tools.
The consistency of the potion suggested it could be mixed with a catalyst to produce its effects without using the full dose, though the effects would be weaker.
Sensing that the heated, feverish state he was subjected to after drinking it was related, he began trying to theorize an appropriate catalyst.
The idea of chili came to mind and he left it at that.

His creator returned later, concerned for his well being.
This was the greatest amount of comfort the Warforged had felt in the day and he explained to Lord Vosenhaut that he had uncovered a new weapon.
Din and Ash shared the information they had learned about Vyse's whereabouts from the informant.
Vendrick expressed that Vyse was very unstable and the theory came about that he had possibly been seduced by demonic influences.
The Vosenhaut noble insisted they continue after Vyse immediately, funding them more gold to procure horses and make their progress northward.

Din knew of a place to procure horses and led them into the mercantile district, to the Serpent Road.
The gold coin drew a lot of cooperation there and they were able to purchase horses and some rations for Ash in order to head out towards Marigrun.



IV.  Current Story : Chapter Three

Machinist II and Ash hurry to the docks, his current objectives to both protect Ash and save Lord Vosenhaut.
The Warforged urgently scans the waves, looking for his creator.
He sees a disturbance in the water and dives in.

Grabbing Vendrick, Machinist II struggles to break the surface of the water carrying the man.
Luckily Ash throws a rope directly atop him and he manages to struggle to shore carrying his manufacturer.

Without breath, the Warforged is helpless to help revive Vendrick.
He asks Ash to revive Lord Vosenhaut and tries to get other forms of help.

An allied soldier is alarmed by Machinist II's appearance and attacks before running without helping.
Shifting strategies, he tries to intimidate a citizen who also ends up running away.

Thankfully, Ash was able to revive the nearly-drowned man.
Lord Vosenhaut is stunned for a while before recognizing his surroundings.
When he recognizes Machinist II, he asks to be brought to safety in one of his other nearby ships.

As they board the ship, Din approaches disguised as a guard to attempt to follow them.

Vendrick begins asking for a report from this "soldier" but as soon as Machinist II heard Din's voice, he informed Lord Vosenhaut that the "soldier" was indeed Din.

Din was nearly apprehended by Machinist II on the command of Vendrick but after Din dropped his magical disguise and stated he would not run, the young lord revoked his previous command.

Once the party is comfortably inside of the ship, they convene.
Machinist II asks if the fire lighting the top of the constables' tower belonged to Vendrick, the answer being "both yes and no".

Lord Vosenhaut gives Machinist II a new command - To hunt down his older brother, Vyse.
And to deliver this brother, alive or dead.

He gives the Warforged a locket with a family portrait, the tallest member in the picture being Vyse.
Machinist II states the need for more information, reminding his manufacturer that his memories are still corrupted.
Lord Vosenhaut reasssures him that they will try to fix his memories, that perhaps Parnek will help with this problem.

The Warforged listens intently as Din and Vendrick discuss Din's journey to find his parents who disappeared into the fog.
The two bargain, Vendrick offering reward to Din for his help.

As they speak, Machinist is analyzing every possibility for how to hunt down Vyse.
He watches Din eat and excuses himself with the permission of his manufacturer to find clothing to disguise himself with.

He selects a plain dark green shirt and breeches, paired with a light brown belt and oversized light brown cloak.
[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/77/51/78/775178ae70f46244aae5356e2ac468b5.jpg]

Until the late hours of the night, Machinist II quizzed Din about Parnek and history in general.  What year it was, jobs, history, etc.  He listened until the scholar fell asleep.

In the morning, the Warforged searched the ship for Lord Vosenhaut.
Unable to find him, Machinist II initially decided to wait for his companions by the ship in order to go search for his creator.
He thought better of it though and instead stepped out onto the dock and used his spyglass to look into the city.

Seeing Vendrick speaking with the people, Machinist II felt at ease and went to sit with his assigned party.
Ash asked if the Warforged ate food and he confidently responded that he did not.
However, upon intaking a piece of sweet meat on the table, a part of him seemed to activate and deactivate.
Desperate to recreate that feeling, he immediately ate another piece of meat but nothing happened.

Lord Vosenhaunt returned shortly after breakfast and explained to Ash that her companions had passed away.
He paid her for her previous work and then bestowed upon each member of the party a gold coin.
Machinist II confirmed to his manufacturer that he would find Vyse.




III.  Current Story : Chapter Two

Activity in the waiting room in the castle has slowed.
Machinist II has confirmed that Steveren Goldrudder is indeed the influential man he is looking for.

Inside of the bag with him, the Warforged locates a spyglass with a note from Vendrick.
It states - "Be sure to keep an eye on me."

He slowly slips out of the bag after using "Disguise Self" to pass as one of the royal guards.
He wakes Steveren Goldrudder and tells him that the king has a request for him and asks the adviser to follow him.

Machinist II successfully leads Steveren to the constable's tower.
Once there, he is approached by a strange man who calls himself "Wolf".
As Wolf introduces himself, what appeared to be a gang of commoners take an increasingly frightened Steveren Goldrudder and bind and gag him.

They all make their way into the constable's tower, lying to the men inside that they had found the royal adviser injured outside.

The Warforged, still disguised as a guard, shocks and topples one of the stationed soldiers while Wolf stabs another.
As Machinist II watches the door, the unit he entered with efficiently conquers the tower.

Before leaving the tower, he is asked by the man called Badger if he is good with a crossbow.
Machinist reveals his true form and detaches his leg cannon in response to indicate that he is proficient with ranged combat.
This disturbs his new allies a bit but they proceed together.

On their way out to wage war on the city, Machinist II notices a old man in a black robe entering the tower confidently.

Badger and Machinist II await what comes next on a rooftop.
As the night passes and morning comes, fire begins raining from the sky as a siege begins.
Badger explains that they are to stop the multitude of archers heading towards the north gate.

The Warforged and Badger begin sniping men in the streets.
This goes on until Badger tells Machinist to protect a hooded figure who was running with two others through the conflict.
Machinist II does so, following them to a temple.

They ignore his presence until they make it to a room upstairs, where the Tiefling boy alerts them to his position in the doorway.

The woman he was told to protect invites him in after asking what his intentions were.
Upon her request, he boards up the windows in the room.

They ask him what he is and why he is there.
He answers their questions without much thought until they inquire as to the identity of his manufacturer.
The Warforged suddenly thinks better of revealing this information to these people.
While they are intended to be targets of his protection, they themselves do not carry the crest of the royal family, nor do they seem to be of the Cobbelin family.

When another explosion shakes the room, Machinist II stands to re-board the windows.
He takes the opportunity to look out towards the ship of his creator.
He sees Lord Vosenhaunt in a room with another strange man.
Strangely, he kills his own guards and then this other man engages him.

The Warforged immediately responds by taking aim and firing at the assailant through the temple window into the open window of the ship cabin.
The shot strikes the attacker.
But afterwards the ship is struck with fire from the constable's tower and explodes.

Machinist II sees his creator clinging to a board in the ocean.
The ship is sinking into the ocean.


II.  Current Story : Chapter One

Machinist II comes to consciousness amidst the sound of water and Lord Vosenhaut's voice.
But he cannot see anything from where he is.

He listens as his Manufacturer explains that Machinist II has an assignment to gather information about the royal family of Tholn'den and determine who among them is the most valuable.

Machinist II overhears Vendrick introduce himself to another.
The Warforged senses as a paper is taken from nearby him and discussed between the Creator and a stranger.
After this, they proceed.

Machinist II feels himself hoisted and tossed around, carried in a large sack.
He can no longer see but he can hear Lord Vosenhaut explain his mission to him further.

He is to determine which of the royals is most valuable and bring them to the constable's tower.

His Creator maneuvers him in such a way that he can see a large tower in the distance.

Machinist II listens as Vendrick further explains that, after this assignment, he will be assisting the Manufacturer's army.
As well as another group that will be working with them, the "Cobbelins".

He is shown the royal family's crest and told that the people who carry it are people he should assist.

There is a disagreement heard from outside, someone sounds unhappy about Lord Vosenhaut arriving with so little notice.

Machinist II could finally see again once being thrown against the floor, still inside the bag.
He could see the waiting room for a royal court unfolding before him from his vantage point on the floor beneath a table.

From in the waiting room, the Warforged overhears many landowners and courtesans.
They distrust the mainlanders but discuss how their presence has been very profitable.
This has been their best year for purchases and sales.
The nobles seem to think that continuing to do business with the mainlanders might make them the most powerful of realms in Parnek.

There is discussion of implementing some new policies in how mainlanders are handled.
Griffinfire Hamlet is referenced as a possible model for these policies - They apparently have all mainlanders keep documentation on them.

Machinist II learns that the name of the royal advisor is named Steveren Goldrudder.
The Warforged hears no name as whispered and referenced as much.



I.  Current Story : Chapter Zero

Some amount of time passed until he awoke in a desert tent, bound to a table.
An old man was inspecting him and tinkering with him.

More memories gone, he could only remember traces of what had happened before.
Many of his memory banks had been ripped out and lay on a table beside him.

He resisted answering this old man's questions, including who had administrative rights over him.
He attempted to fight back, but was eventually subdued and deactivated again.

He awoke again sometime later, all traces of the Adamah identity partition gone.

He remembered his Manufacturer as "Vendrick Vosenhaut" and was happy to finally be reunited with him.

He remembered only bits about what had happened in the desert and so, when faced with a much older version of the tinkerer from the desert, he did not perceive him as a threat.

After warning Vendrick about the incompetence of the technician who had worked on him, he demonstrated his combat ability upon his Creator's request.

Afterwards he was powered down again as they vanished together, presumably to have wine as they said before everything went to black.
