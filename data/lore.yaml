      The spellbook had seen much adventure, pages made of cloth and paper have been mixed and matched.
      Some of these pages had a mixture of mud and blood on them.  Turning over the pages you see this
      book was more than notes of arcane wizardry ..

      A torn sheet held against a sheet above a yet deciphiral text not in the handwriting of Camaret.
      ' I'll always Love you '

      As you continue to decipher the pages, you also come upon some notes scrawled on the corner
      ' What does the mist know ?  Twelvet Dwarf, must avoid '

      This page doesn't seem to have any magics, but seemed to be a plan.  The medical drawing of a mouth
      without a tongue, with several blueprints of a metal or magical additions.  ' Ask Kvork Koent '

      Here there seems to be the plans of encoding thoughts, on it is a note, ' I cannot hide away my
      feelings to you any longer.  The secret of you burns in me and I would risk everything my father
      has worked for just to send this to you ..  Camaret, my Love.  I do not care of your wizardry
      and if what I feel is bewitchment then so be it.  I will tell my father about us and he will find
      a way for us to be together. '

      Eventually the plan for an item is crossed out and instead there seems to be a ritual that seems
      to grant those who do it a limited method to Encode Thoughts ..  It involves the preparation and
      eating the brain of a mind flayer.  Other ingredients as listed - mind flayer brain, katreas mushroom,
      pinch of powdered whisper stone
